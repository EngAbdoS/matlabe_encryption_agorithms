<h1>Encryption Algorithms in MATLAB with GUI</h1>
<p>This repository contains MATLAB implementations of several encryption algorithms along with decoding and encoding functions, as well as a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for ease of use. The algorithms included are:</p>

<ul>
 <li>   Cipher Algorithm </li>
 <li>   Hill Algorithm</li>
 <li>   Linear Block Algorithm</li>
 <li>   Vigenere Algorithm</li>
<li>Playfair Algorithm</li>
</ul>

<p>This algorithms coded by Abdelrahman Swidan, a CS student at Suez Canal University.</p>


<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>To use these algorithms, simply clone the repository to your local machine or download the zip file. The MATLAB files for each algorithm are located in their respective folders. The GUI is located in the main directory, and can be run by opening the encryption_gui.m file.</p>

<h1>Usage</h1>
<p>To use the GUI, simply open the encryption_gui.m file and run it. The GUI will prompt you to select which encryption algorithm you want to use, and will then guide you through the process of entering the plaintext or ciphertext and the encryption key. After entering the necessary information, the GUI will output the encoded or decoded text.</p>


<h2>Playfair Algorithm</h2>
<p>The Playfair Algorithm is a polygraphic substitution cipher that uses a 5x5 matrix of letters to encrypt pairs of letters in the plaintext.</p>
<h2>Cipher Algorithm</h2>
<p>The Cipher Algorithm is a substitution cipher that replaces each letter in the plaintext with a different letter in the ciphertext. The algorithm uses a key that specifies the substitution rules.</p>
<h2>Hill Algorithm</h2>
<p>The Hill Algorithm is a polygraphic substitution cipher that operates on blocks of letters. The algorithm uses a key matrix to transform the plaintext into ciphertext.</p>
<h2>Linear Block Algorithm</h2>
<p>The Linear Block Algorithm is a block cipher that operates on fixed-length groups of bits. The algorithm uses a key that specifies the transformation rules.</p>
<h2>Vigenere Algorithm</h2>
<p>The Vigenere Algorithm is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher that uses a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers based on a keyword.</p>
